# Installing the PIP - Python Package Manager

## Prerequisites

Before installing the PIP, you must have Python installed on your system. You can check if Python is installed by opening a terminal window and entering the following command:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## Installation steps

1. Once you have confirmed that Python is installed, you can download the `get-pip.py` installation script by running the following command:

    ```bash
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    ```
    
    If you don't have the `curl` installed, you can manually download the file `get-pip.py` from this link `https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py` 
2. Next, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `get-pip.py` script in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command to install `pip`

    ```bash
    python get-pip.py
    ```

    This will start the `pip` installation process
4. Once pip has finished installing, you can verify that it was installed correctly by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip --version
    ```
