# Launching AWS CloudShell

AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell that you can use to interact directly with your AWS resources. In this guide, we will walk you through how to launch AWS CloudShell from your laptop.

## Step 1: Log in to AWS Management Console

First, you will need to log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). 

## Step 2: Open AWS CloudShell

Once you are logged in to the AWS Management Console, you can launch CloudShell by clicking on the CloudShell icon in the upper right corner of the console.

The icon looks like a '>' symbol.

Clicking on the icon will open a new pane at the bottom of your screen. This is the AWS CloudShell.

## Step 3: Start using AWS CloudShell

Once CloudShell has launched, you can start using it to interact with your AWS resources.

You can type AWS CLI commands directly into the CloudShell. It comes pre-configured with AWS CLI, so there is no need for you to install or manage any software.

Note that AWS CloudShell is available at no extra charge, but standard rates for other AWS services used with CloudShell still apply.

If you are new to AWS CLI or CloudShell, AWS provides comprehensive guides and tutorials that you can follow. You can find these in the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html).

## Conclusion

That's it! You have now successfully launched AWS CloudShell from your laptop. You can now interact with your AWS resources directly from your browser.
