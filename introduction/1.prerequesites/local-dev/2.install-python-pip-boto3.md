# Installing the PIP - Python Package Manager

## Prerequisites

Before installing the PIP, you must have Python installed on your system. You can check if Python is installed by opening a terminal window and entering the following command:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## Installation steps

1. Once you have confirmed that Python is installed, you can download the `get-pip.py` installation script. If your Python version is less than 3.7, use the following command:

    ```bash
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    ```

    If your Python version is 3.7 or higher, use the following command:

    ```bash
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    ```
    If you don't have the `curl` installed, you can manually download the file `get-pip.py` from this link `https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py` 

2. Next, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `get-pip.py` script in your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to install `pip`

    ```bash
    python get-pip.py
    ```

    This will start the `pip` installation process
4. Once pip has finished installing, you can verify that it was installed correctly by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip --version
    ```
5. After successfully installing pip, you can install Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, by running:

    ```bash
    pip install boto3
    ```

6. Once Boto3 has finished installing, you can verify that it was installed correctly by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python -c "import boto3; print(boto3.__version__)"
    ```
