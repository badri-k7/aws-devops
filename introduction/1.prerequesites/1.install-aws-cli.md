# Installing the AWS CLI

## Prerequisites

Before installing the AWS CLI, you must have Python installed on your system. You can check if Python is installed by opening a terminal window and entering the following command:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## Installation Steps

1. Download the AWS CLI installation package:

   For Linux and macOS:
   ```bash
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
   ```

   For Windows:
   ```bash
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi -OutFile AWSCLIV2.msi
   ```

2. Extract the contents of the zip file by entering the following command:

   For Linux and macOS:
   ```bash
   unzip awscliv2.zip
   ```

   For Windows, double-click the MSI file and follow the instructions to install the AWS CLI.

3. Run the installation script by entering the following command:

   For Linux and macOS:
   ```bash
   sudo ./aws/install
   ```

   For Windows, open the Command Prompt or PowerShell and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the MSI file. Then, enter the following command:
   ```bash
   msiexec.exe /i AWSCLIV2.msi
   ```

4. Verify that the AWS CLI is installed correctly by entering the following command:

   ```bash 
   aws --version
   ```

   This command should return the version number of the AWS CLI.

5. Once the AWS CLI is installed, you need to configure your AWS CLI credentials. These   credentials can be obtained from the AWS Event Engine platform, which will be provided to you at the time of the workshop
   You can configure your AWS CLI credentials by entering the following command:

   ```bash 
   aws configure
   ```


## Conclusion

You have successfully installed the AWS CLI on your system. Now you can use it to interact with AWS services from the command line. For more information about using the AWS CLI, refer to the official documentation: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/.
