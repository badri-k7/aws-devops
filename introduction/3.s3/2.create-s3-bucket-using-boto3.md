# Boto3 steps to create S3 bucket

Here are the steps to create an S3 bucket using the `boto3` Python library:

1. Open the Python terminal in your command prompt. If you're using Windows, you can type `py` into your command prompt. On MacOS or Linux, you can type `python` or `python3`.

2. Import the boto3 library:
    ```python
    import boto3
    ```
3. Create a new `boto3 S3` client:
    ```python
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    ```
4. Create a new S3 bucket using the create_bucket method. Replace my-bucket-name with the name you want to give to your bucket, and replace us-east-1 with the region where you want to create the bucket:
    ```python
    s3.create_bucket(Bucket='my-bucket-name', CreateBucketConfiguration={'LocationConstraint': 'us-east-1'})
    ```
