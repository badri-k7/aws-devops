# Workshop Modules Overview

Welcome to the workshop modules that are designed to introduce you to various AWS services. You will be interacting with them using the AWS CLI and Python's Boto3 library.

This directory contains two main parts: `local-dev` and `remote-dev`, which are essential for setting up your AWS development environment. Depending on your needs, you can choose to set up your environment locally on your machine or remotely.

For a local setup, please visit the [local-dev](./1.prerequesites/local-dev/README.md) directory and follow the instructions provided.

For a remote setup, refer to the instructions in the [remote-dev](./1.prerequesites/remote-dev/README.md) directory.

After setting up your development environment and completing the prerequisites, you can proceed with the EC2 and S3 modules:
