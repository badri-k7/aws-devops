To install DynamoDB locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the DynamoDB local JAR file from the AWS website. The download page can be found [here]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html).
2. Extract the downloaded JAR file to a directory on your computer.
3. Launch DynamoDB local using the following command in a terminal or command prompt window:
    ```bash
    java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb
    ```
    This command launches the DynamoDB local server and creates a shared database that can be accessed by multiple clients.
4. Verify that DynamoDB local is running by opening a web browser and navigating to the following URL: http://localhost:8000/shell/

    This will open the DynamoDB local shell in your web browser, allowing you to interact with the local database.
