# To create a DynamoDB table using the AWS CLI Command

1. This command creates a DynamoDB table with a table name of my-table, a key schema consisting of a hash key 'id', sort key 'timestamp' and a attribute definitions for the `id` attribute of type `S` (String) and `timestamp` attribute of type `N`(Number) It also sets the provisioned throughput to `5 read capacity units` and `5 write capacity units`.

    ```bash
    aws dynamodb create-table \
    --table-name my-table \
    --attribute-definitions AttributeName=id,AttributeType=S \
    --key-schema AttributeName=id,KeyType=HASH \
    --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5
    ```

    A read capacity unit (RCU) represents one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually consistent reads per second, for an item up to 4 KB in size. If the item is larger than 4 KB, additional RCUs are required to read the item. Strongly consistent reads are guaranteed to return the most recent version of an item, while eventually consistent reads may return a version of an item that is not the most recent.

    A write capacity unit (WCU) represents one write per second for an item up to 1 KB in size. If the item is larger than 1 KB, additional WCUs are required to write the item. A write can include creating a new item, updating an existing item, or deleting an existing item.
