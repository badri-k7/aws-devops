# To process a message from an SQS queue using the boto3 Python library, you can follow these steps:
1. Import the required modules:
    ```python
    import boto3
    from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
    ```
2. Create an SQS client and define the queue name:
    ```python
    sqs = boto3.client('sqs')
    queue_name = 'my-queue'
    ```
3. Get the queue URL:
    ```python
    try:
        response = sqs.get_queue_url(QueueName=queue_name)
        queue_url = response['QueueUrl']
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f'Error getting SQS queue URL: {e}')
    ```
4. Receive messages from the queue:
    ```python
    try:
        response = sqs.receive_message(QueueUrl=queue_url, MaxNumberOfMessages=1, WaitTimeSeconds=20)
        if 'Messages' in response:
            message = response['Messages'][0]
            receipt_handle = message['ReceiptHandle']
            message_body = message['Body']
            print(f'Received message from SQS queue with body: {message_body}')
            # delete the message from the queue
            sqs.delete_message(QueueUrl=queue_url, ReceiptHandle=receipt_handle)
        else:
            print('No messages in the queue')
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f'Error receiving message from SQS queue: {e}')
    ```

In this example, we assume that you have already created an SQS queue with the name `my-queue` and that there is at least one message in the queue. We use the `get_queue_url` method to retrieve the URL of the queue, and then use the `receive_message` method to receive up to one message from the queue. The `receive_message` method waits for up to 20 seconds for a message to become available. If there is at least one message in the response, we extract the message body and receipt handle from the first message in the Messages list. We then print the message body as a confirmation message and delete the message from the queue using the `delete_message` method with the receipt handle. If there are no messages in the queue, we print a message indicating that the queue is empty.
