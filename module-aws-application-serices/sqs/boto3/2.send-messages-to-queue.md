# To send a message to an SQS queue using the boto3 Python library, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the required modules:
    ```python
    import boto3
    from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
    ```

2. Create an SQS client and define the queue name:
    ```python
    sqs = boto3.client('sqs')
    queue_name = 'my-queue'
    ```

3. Get the queue URL:
    ```python
    try:
        response = sqs.get_queue_url(QueueName=queue_name)
        queue_url = response['QueueUrl']
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f'Error getting SQS queue URL: {e}')
    ```

4. Send a message to the queue:
    ```python
    message_body = 'Hello from SQS!'
    try:
        response = sqs.send_message(QueueUrl=queue_url, MessageBody=message_body)
        print(f'Successfully sent message to SQS queue with message ID: {response["MessageId"]}')
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f'Error sending message to SQS queue: {e}')
    ```

In this example, we assume that you have already created an SQS queue with the name `my-queue`. We use the `get_queue_url` method to retrieve the URL of the queue, and then use the `send_message` method to send a message with the body 'Hello from SQS!' to the queue. The `send_message` method returns a dictionary containing the `MessageId` of the sent message. We extract the `MessageId` from the response and print it as a confirmation message.
