# To create an SQS queue using the boto3 Python library, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the required modules:
    ```python
    import boto3
    from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
    ```
2. Create an SQS client
    ```python
    sqs = boto3.client('sqs')
    ```
3. Define the queue name and create the queue:
    ```python
    queue_name = 'my-queue'
    try:
        response = sqs.create_queue(QueueName=queue_name)
        queue_url = response['QueueUrl']
        print(f'Successfully created SQS queue with URL: {queue_url}')
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f'Error creating SQS queue: {e}')
    ```

In this example, we define the name of the queue as `my-queue`. The `create_queue` method creates the queue with the given name and returns a dictionary containing the `QueueUrl` of the newly created queue. We extract the `QueueUrl` from the response and print it as a confirmation message.
